# Phantom Agent Privilege
## Privilege Attribution Check

Answer Yes or No.

1. Do all agent-created credentials record creator identity, purpose, scope, and expiry?
2. Can every non-human identity be traced to a documented workflow or ticketed change?
3. Are agent permissions bounded by predefined baselines for each workflow?
4. Are privileges auto-revoked when workflows terminate or exceed time limits?
5. Is there an approval gate for any agent-created privilege above read-only?

Interpretation:
- Any "No" indicates potential phantom agent privilege exposure.
- Two or more "No" responses indicates elevated risk and warrants immediate review.
